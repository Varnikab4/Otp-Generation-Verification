OTP Generation and Verification Project
This project utilizes React.js, CSS, and Firebase to implement a secure OTP generation and verification system. It allows users to submit queries with their contact details, generates and sends OTPs via SMS using Firebase Authentication, and verifies the OTP entered by the user. Upon successful verification, the user's query is stored in Firebase Realtime Database.

Features:

Firebase Authentication: Integrates Firebase's phone authentication for secure OTP generation and verification.
React.js Frontend: Implements a user-friendly interface for submitting queries and entering OTPs.
Realtime Database: Stores user queries securely in Firebase Realtime Database upon successful verification.
Responsive Design: Utilizes CSS for responsive and visually appealing UI across devices.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js, CSS
Backend: Firebase (Authentication, Realtime Database)
Deployment: Deployed on a hosting platform for easy access and scalability.
Usage:
Users enter their name, phone number, email, and query in the submission form.
Upon submission, an OTP is sent to the provided phone number for verification.
Users enter the OTP received to verify their identity.
Once verified, the query along with timestamp is stored securely in Firebase for administrative review and response.

Purpose:
This project aims to provide a secure and efficient way for users to contact and receive responses from administrators while ensuring data privacy and authentication using Firebase services.
